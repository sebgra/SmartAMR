    <p>
      As antibiotic resistance keeps rising, putting at risk the medical core's ability to take therapeutic action against baterial infection, we face an alarming situation.
      It is estimated that, by 2050, we will reach a therapeutic dead end, which will likely lead to a raise in infection mortality. 
      In order to face this challenge, it is necessary to find alternative treatments limiting the development of bacterial resistance.

      Phages are a strong candidate of such alternatives, as they inately have all the mecanisms necessary to attack and destroy bacteria.
      With SmartAMR, we provide doctors and researchers with the ability to estimate the efficiency of a phage towards specific bateria from proteic sequences.
